Forked library that works as a replacement for this [library](https://github.com/daviddesberg/PHPoAuthLib). Just follow the magento oauth [devdocs]( https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-oauth/) for the extra files needed.



PHPoAuthLib
===========
**NOTE: I'm looking for someone who could help to maintain this package alongside me, just because I don't have a ton of time to devote to it. However, I'm still going to keep trying to pay attention to PRs, etc.**

PHPoAuthLib provides oAuth support in PHP 7.2+ and is very easy to integrate with any project which requires an oAuth client.
